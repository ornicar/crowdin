// Technical words such as "part of the ``<head>``" are to be avoided at all costs. When they do occur, a rigorous description must _always_ be trailing them, since translations are constantly being refined after being completed and even new ones are rarely translated in one go. Even the term "home page" is too technical (requires knowledge of common internet conventions) for the purposes of the project, as it is called "Play" on lichess.

// Contexts are to be kept as short as possible, while maintaining grammatical sense. Therefore, statements such as "This sentence is self-explanatory" have no place in the contexts.

// Contexts (as well as source strings) must have a strong sense of internal consistency, e.g. you should use "signed in" instead of "logged in" or "connected", if your button for accessing a user account says "Sign in" on it.

// There is no guideline on what pronoun to use when giving examples, but addressing the translator directly (the second person) is preferred. In synoptical descriptions, passive voice is preferred.

// Stylistically, the author of this document prefers [WP:MOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:MOS). This style guide includes insightful guidelines about all aspects of the usage of the English language. For instance, it recommends against the usage of contractions (e.g. "It's" as opposed to "It is"). However, these guidelines are beyond the scope of this document.
